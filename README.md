TwitterFeed
===========

TwitterFeed

It connects to Twitter using Twitter OAUTH. TwitterFeed uses Backbone.js and JQuery.

  > Try index.html for the default functionalities.

  > Try index_updated.html for the functionalities underscore.js.

In both of the cases, it uses auth.php file for authentication. If you want to change the Hashtag, you can edit that inside auth.php file. Just change, $search = "#Bangladesh"!

In Future
=========
I will update the app with:

  > Require JS for bonus points
  
  > Twitter bootstrap for bonus points
